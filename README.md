## About Us

NeuralDot is a student research group focused on algorithms implementing artificial intelligence. 

We pick up interesting papers to break them down and understand them thoroughly. 

Our aim is to learn and discover the models and practices used by cutting-edge research projects around the world. 

We occasionally conduct sessions wherein we teach and implement concepts to acquaint newcomers to the field of data science.
